* A button in the stage controls to resize the stage
* A label in the stage controls that shows the position of the mouse cursor on the stage
* Resizing the stage according to \_twconfig\_
* New category "StageSC" ![StageSC category](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DDen4ik-12/Stage-Size-Changer/refs/heads/main/readmeAssets/stageSizeChangerCategory.png) and blocks:
